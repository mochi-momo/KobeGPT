Hello, my name is Mohit Singh and this is a friend recommendation framework I developed for online social networks as a part of my research under the National Science Foundation REU program.

To use this code you will have to create an artificial dataset using the dataset generation folder and run it using the driver file. You will also need to obtain an API key to use OpenAI's embeddings API. Feel free to fine-tune the framework to test different methods.

Feel free to contact me!
